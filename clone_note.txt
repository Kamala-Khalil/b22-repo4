I just created Empty Remote repostry from GitHub.com account by clicking on the plus icon on top rigth corner and new repostry
and give a name and click create




And cloned this repostry by clicking  on Set up in Destkop and (optionally select the location) click on clone 

It cloned our remote  repo to local so we can start working locally
